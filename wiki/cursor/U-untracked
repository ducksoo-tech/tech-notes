# What does "U" (Untracked) mean in Cursor?

In the left sidebar of Cursor, you might see a **`U`** next to some files.

This **`U` stands for "Untracked"**, which means the file (in this case, README.md) is not currently being tracked by Git. Git doesn't monitor changes to this file yet.

To start tracking it, you need to add it using this command in the terminal:

```bash
git add README.md
